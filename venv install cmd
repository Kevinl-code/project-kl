Installation of Virtual Environment
      pip install virtualenv

Checking Version for python
      python --version

  To create a Python virtual environment in your desired folder, follow these steps:

1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to your desired folder:
   Use the `cd` command to change to your desired directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/desired/folder
   ```

3. Run the command to create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv_name
   ```
   Replace `venv_name` with the name you want to give your virtual environment.

For example:
```bash
python -m venv myenv
```
This will create a folder named `myenv` in your desired directory containing the virtual environment.

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate


Once activated, you'll see the virtual environment name in your terminal prompt, indicating that you're working inside the environment.

Additional Notes:
- If you don't have `venv` installed, you can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install virtualenv
  ``` 
- Ensure you're using the correct Python version by running:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
